Program Notes:

Analogy for Map usage:

	Imagine a filing cabinet: 
	1. coursesByYear - top level folders; labeled by year
	2. termMap - subfolders of coursesByYear; labeled by term number
	3. courseList - the documents stored in the termMap

    Initially, the sorting per term and per year was based of a stupid for loop iterating through specific indexes of an ArrayList within a term.
    we figured that it would be very inefficient to implement that every time, and found that utilizing a nested HashMap would be a good solution
    for using the year and term as the keys, and the other objects/data as our values.
